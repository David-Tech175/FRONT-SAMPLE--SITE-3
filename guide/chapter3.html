   <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
   <h2>Guide for Voting Assistance Officers</h2>
   <h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">A Uniformed Service member who is living within their voting jurisdiction and can vote locally is not covered under <em>UOCAVA</em>.</p>
   <p>As a Voting Assistance Officer (VAO), you are part of a worldwide network of military members, U.S. government employees, and volunteers who aid in ensuring that citizens covered under the <em>Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)</em> understand their voting rights and know how to vote absentee.</p>
   <p><strong>These citizens include:</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>An active duty member of the Uniformed Services, Merchant Marine, or commissioned corps of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
    <li>An eligible spouse or family member of an active duty member of the Uniformed Services, Merchant Marine, or commissioned corps of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</li>
    <li>U.S. citizens residing outside the U.S.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The following areas will be covered in this chapter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Create an FVAP.gov Portal Account (Military only)</li>
    <li>Help Voters</li>
    <li>Conduct voter outreach events</li>
    <li>Keep voting supplies on hand</li>
    <li>Additional assistance</li>
    <li>Run your program</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Create an FVAP.gov Portal Account (Military only)</h3>
   <p>To assist your Service Branch in demonstrating that assistance is being provided according to federal law, DoD policy, and Service policy, an easy-to-use Administration Portal has been created for you to enter your voting assistance metrics.</p>
   <p><strong>Registering for an Account / Logging In:</strong></p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">A quick video is also available here: <a title="FVAP.gov/metrics-training-webinar" href="../metrics-training-webinar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov/metrics-training-webinar</strong></a>.</p>
   <p>On your first visit you will need to register for an FVAP portal account to submit metrics.</p>
   <p>You can do this from any page on <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and on the right you will see the "Admin Portal" link.</p>
   <p>Click the Admin Portal link and you will have the option to sign in or to create an account. Click "Create Account", and the Portal will walk you through the process of creating an account. Your account will be automatically approved if you have a .mil or a .gov email address and provide the name of your unit. If you do not have a .mil or .gov email address, or you cannot locate your unit in the portal, contact your Service Voting Action Officer. They will assist you finding your unit and approving your account.</p>
   <p>If you visited the Portal before, you can login using your DoD Common Access Card.</p>
   <p><strong>Entering Data:</strong></p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">If you have any technical questions, please contact <a title="tech@fvap.gov" href="mailto:tech@fvap.gov"><strong>tech@fvap.gov</strong></a>.</p>
   <p>Once you log in you will see your VAO Dashboard. Click the metrics tab along the left sidebar.</p>
   <p>The current calendrical quarter is indicated in the top left corner with text fields for entering your metrics. All your metrics are stored here. You also have the ability to view past metrics and export them into a</p>
   <p>PDF. If your metrics haven't been saved for the current quarter yet, a red box will be in the top right corner.</p>
   <p>In the table there are spaces to insert your metrics data. For example, if you assist 10 military members with an FPCA, then under the "Personnel Assisted" table, you would insert "10" where the "Military" column intersects with the "FPCA" row. If you distributed 50 FPCAs in a PDF format by email, then in the "Forms Distributed" table you insert "50" where the "FPCA" column intersects with the "Electronic" row.</p>
   <p>Note: metrics do not automatically aggregate. For example, during January you assisted 5 military members with their FPCAs. So, on February 1, you would insert "5" where the "Military" column intersects with the "FPCA" row.</p>
   <p>In February, you then assist 6 more military members with their FPCA.&nbsp;In this case, on March 1 you would add the January totals with the&nbsp;February totals, and change the "5" to an "11". You can then continue&nbsp;to make additions to the total quarter numbers right up until the end&nbsp;of the quarter.</p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Always make sure to hit the save button!</p>
   <p>Make sure to <em>hit the "Save" button </em>every time you enter any new numbers! Once metrics are saved, you will then see the green box above the "Export to PDF" button.</p>
   <p>Under the "Forms Distributed" table you will see a table called&nbsp;"Mandatory Questions". Check "Yes" or "No" to each of these&nbsp;questions by the end of each quarter. You have the option to&nbsp;change your response to any of the questions anytime during&nbsp;the quarter, provided that the changes are saved by 2400hrs&nbsp;Eastern Time on the last day of the quarter. Each question relates&nbsp;to the entire quarter just like the rest of the metric fields. If you&nbsp;report metrics monthly, please note that any changes you make&nbsp;to answers already submitted will override your previous&nbsp;answers for the quarter. So, if you answered "Yes" to a question&nbsp;previously, you have to leave it as a "Yes" in order for that "Yes"&nbsp;answer to be counted for the quarter.</p>
   <p>The additional questions on the metrics page are:</p>

   <h3>Determining voting residency</h3>
   <p>To vote in U.S. elections, citizens must have a legal voting residence address in a state or territory. The issue of voting residence depends on individual circumstances.</p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">A voting residence establishes the jurisdiction to which the citizen must submit voting materials.</p>
   <p><strong>For Uniformed Service members and their eligible family members:</strong> For voting purposes, legal voting residence can be in the state or territory where the individual last resided prior to entering military service, or the state or territory that the individual has since claimed as their legal residence. Even though the individual no longer maintains formal ties to that residence, the address determines their proper voting jurisdiction. To claim a new legal residence, an individual must have simultaneous physical presence and intend to return to that location as their primary residence.</p> Uniformed Service members and their eligible family members may change their residence every time they change permanent duty stations, or they may keep their residence at their previous location. This may mean that the family's Uniformed Service member has a different voting residence than his/her family members, because family members do not automatically assume the residence of the member. 
   <p>Individuals should consult a legal assistance officer if they are not sure of their voting residence, because there are usually other factors that should be considered besides voting.</p>
   <p>Spouses of Uniformed Service members may change their residency to that of the Uniformed Service members without establishing residency in that state.</p>
   <p>Contact your legal assistance officer for help determining legal residence.</p>
   <p><strong>For overseas citizens:</strong> Overseas citizens' legal state of residence for voting purposes is the state or territory where they last resided immediately prior to their departure from the United States. This applies to overseas citizens even if they do not have property or other ties in the last state of residence. Children of these citizens should use the residence address of one of their parents or legal guardians. In most states, those who were born abroad and have never resided in the United States are eligible to vote absentee using their parent or legal guardian's address. To see if your state allows this, check the state pages in Chapter 2 of the Voting Assistance Guide (Guide) or find the listing online at <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>.</p>
   <h3>Helping individuals complete the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA)</h3>
   <p>The FPCA can be used by Uniformed Service members, their eligible family members, and overseas citizens to simultaneously register to vote and request an absentee ballot. As a VAO, you should help individuals correctly complete their FPCAs. Election officials determine the voter's eligibility to vote based on information provided in this application. Individuals should include all contact information on their FPCA and submit it early enough for election officials to contact them if they need additional information to process the form.</p>
   <p><strong>Check that FPCAs are filled out correctly and include:</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>Signature and date</li>
    <li>Complete U.S. voting residence address (no P.O. Box addresses)</li>
    <li>Legible handwriting</li>
    <li>All information required by the state</li>
    <li>Complete current address (must be a different address than the voting residence address)</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Forms should not be sent directly to FVAP or an embassy/consulate as they are unable to process them.</p>
   <p>Remind voters to send the FPCA early enough to be received by the state registration and/or absentee ballot request deadline. If you are working in an IVA Office, offer to mail forms on behalf of the voter. Remember, collected forms must be mailed within five calendar days. Overseas voters must contact their embassy or consulate prior to dropping off forms.</p>
   <h3>Helping complete the Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot (FWAB)</h3>
   <p>If Uniformed Service members, their eligible family members and overseas citizens have requested, but have not received their state absentee ballot in time to vote and return it before the deadline, they should use the FWAB.</p>
   <p>If citizens receive their state absentee ballot after submitting the FWAB, they should vote and return the state absentee ballot immediately. If the election office receives the state absentee ballot by the ballot return deadline, the state absentee ballot will be counted instead of the FWAB.</p>
   <div class="blockquote-right info">
    <strong>Federal offices include:</strong>
    <ul>
     <li>The President and Vice President</li>
     <li>U.S. Senators</li>
     <li>U.S. Representatives</li>
     <li>U.S. Delegates (American Samoa, District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands)</li>
     <li>U.S. Resident Commissioner (Puerto Rico)</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <ul>
    <li>To use the FWAB, citizens should have applied for a state absentee ballot before the state's ballot request deadline.</li>
    <li>The FWAB may be used to vote for federal offices in primary, general, special, or runoff elections.</li>
    <li>Some states have expanded the use of the FWAB and accept the FWAB for voting for state and local offices, and/or allow the FWAB to be used for voter registration and ballot request. Please see state information in <strong>Chapter 2</strong>.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Tips for using the FWAB:</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>Individuals who have not received a requested state absentee ballot in time to return it before the election should immediately complete and send the FWAB to their election office. FVAP recommends voters use a FWAB if they have not received their state absentee ballot within 30 days of the election.</li>
    <li>The FWAB must be received by the election office no later than the ballot return deadline for that election.</li>
    <li>The Voter Information page must be completed and the mailing envelope must be signed and dated.</li>
   </ul>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Overseas citizen groups and local election officials are excellent resources and VAOs should partner with them to conduct voting events.</p>
   <h2>Conduct voter outreach events</h2>
   <p>Each regularly scheduled federal election year (every even-numbered year), FVAP works with the Uniformed Services and the Department of State to promote voter registration and absentee voting by conducting Voting Emphasis Weeks.</p>

   <h2>Additional assistance</h2>
   <p>The Uniformed Services have extensive chains of command to provide voting support for military members and their families.</p>
   <p><strong>Installation Commanding Officer (CO)</strong></p>
   <p>The Installation Commander oversees voting assistance for the Installation Voter Assistance (IVA) Office. The IVA Office staff report directly to the Installation Commander while staffing the IVA Office. FVAP requests that Commanders make opening statements at FVAP workshops and facilitate travel arrangements for VAOs to attend workshops at surrounding installations.</p>
   <p><strong>Installation Voting Assistance Officer (IVAO)</strong></p>
   <p>The IVAO acts as a focal point on military installations in coordinating voting assistance support. IVAOs should maintain a roster of all unit VAOs on the installation, establish communications with VAOs, and provide necessary materials and support. IVAOs coordinate FVAP workshops with organizations from their installation and surrounding installations.</p>
   <p><strong>Installation Voter Assistance (IVA) Office Staff</strong></p>
   <p>These are people who staff the IVA Office. They provide assistance to military personnel, eligible family members, as well as civilian personnel and other civilians who have access to the office. They provide written instruction on voter registration and absentee ballot procedures and report directly to the installation commander. These individuals can be contacted with questions regarding local voting.</p>
   <p><strong>Legal Assistance Officer</strong></p>
   <p>This officer can be contacted with legal questions, such as determining voter residency. Often known as a JAG (Judge Advocate General) officer.</p>
   <p><strong>Public Affairs/Information Officer</strong></p>
   <p>Contact this officer to ensure that voting information is included in installation or unit publications.</p>
   <p><strong>Inspector General (IG)</strong></p>
   <p>The IG is required by federal law to periodically review voting assistance programs to ensure compliance with DoD and Service directives and regulations.</p>
   <p><strong>Personnel/Human Resources Officer</strong></p>
   <p>Contact this officer to ensure that all newly reporting personnel and naturalized U.S. citizens are provided FPCAs and voting assistance.</p>

   <h3>Legal guidelines</h3>
   <p>VAOs must not provide partisan voting information from candidates, political parties, or partisan organizations. Military VAOs may receive questions from voters regarding whether they can distribute and/or display partisan materials at the military installations. VAOs should consult their Commanding Officer for their interpretation of <em>DoD Directive 1344.10 Political Activities by Members of the Armed Forces on Active Duty,</em> available online at <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>. Federally employed VAOs should refer to the <em>Hatch Act, Title 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7321,</em> link available online at <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>.</p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Make sure to sign up for an <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a> portal account by scrolling to the bottom of any page on <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>&nbsp;and selecting "Admin Portal". Once you have an account you can enter in your quarterly metrics and access other resources.</p>
   <p>VAOs can advise citizens on locating information on candidates and issues using national, local and Service newspapers, magazines, radio, television, political party and campaign committee offices, overseas newspapers and periodicals, and state election websites.</p>
   <h3>Continuity folder</h3>
   <p>Continuity of your program is important for you, your assistant, your organization, and your successor. Create and maintain a Continuity Folder for your reference and to ensure that your successor understands what they are supposed to do. It should provide basic details on absentee voting procedures and contain anything that may help your backup or successor. Your folder should also provide a quick orientation of VAO responsibilities. It can be in the form of a notebook, file folder, or an online community folder, so long as it is readily available to other VAOs and assistants.</p> Your Continuity Folder should contain at a minimum: 
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Never include Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about individuals you have assisted!</p>
   <p class="blockquote-right important">Best practices include maintaining hard copies of inspectable documentation which may include training certificates, appointment letters, and a copy of your most recent metrics report.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Your VAO Designation Letter (only military VAOs)</li>
    <li>Current FPCAs and FWABs</li>
    <li>Current Voting Assistance Guide (updates available online at <br /><strong><a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FVAP.gov</a></strong>)</li>
    <li>Recent news releases</li>
    <li>Election Dates Calendar (during even-numbered years)</li>
    <li>Current State Department or Service guidance (directive, instruction, order, etc.)</li>
    <li>DoD Instruction 1000.04. (Federal Voting Assistance Program) and your Service Voting Action Plan</li>
    <li>Training materials and certificate from workshops</li>
    <li>Good ideas and lessons learned</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Most VAO and IVA Office Continuity Folder documents can be downloaded in the VAO Continuity Folder section online at<strong> <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FVAP.gov</a></strong>. You can find all materials listed above in the VAO section of <a title="FVAP.gov" href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FVAP.gov</strong></a>&nbsp;or through your normal Service supply chain.</p>
   <p>Your SVAO may also have Continuity Folder requirements, for more details, see your Service Voting Action Plan.</p>
